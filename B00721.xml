            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:173885:11"/> ſtudy, and wee ought to ſpend the more time in the reading and in the meditating of ſo excellent and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a Booke.</p>
               <p>This Pſalme is ſet downe before the reſt,<note place="margin">This <hi>Pſalm</hi> is a preface to the whole Booke of Pſalmes. Iohn 5.39.</note> as a Preface to ſtirre vp euery faithfull Chriſtian, to the dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and carefull ſtudy of the holy Scriptures, and the bleſſed Booke of GOD as our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>Search the Scriptures, &amp;c.</hi> Becauſe that will bring a man to true happineſſe in the end; namely, to know GOD to bee his GOD, to know IESVS CHRIST, to know himſelfe, and to direct him in the narrow way that leadeth vnto life.</p>
               <p>This firſt Pſalme is ſet downe without any inſcription,<note place="margin">As <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> and <hi>Hilar.</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is vncertaine by whom it was penned; whether by <hi>Dauid,</hi> as moſt like it was; or by <hi>Eſdras,</hi> who is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thought to haue gathered them together, and ioyned them thus in one Volume or Booke as now wee haue them.</p>
               <p>This Pſalme doth teach vs theſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:173885:12"/> two worthy points; namely, how the godly man liues and walkes in this world,<note place="margin">Summe of the <hi>Pſalme.</hi>
                  </note> what manner of life hee leads on earth, and alſo what happineſſe and bleſſedneſſe is reſerued for him in the life to come in heauen, <hi>v.</hi> 1.2.3 The ſecond part ſhewes the contrary life of the wicked and vngodly, as alſo what fearefull vengeance and eternall iudgements are prepared for them. <hi>ver.</hi> 4.5.</p>
               <p>And the parts of this Pſalme are two: In the former part is a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of the contrary eſtate of the godly man and the wicked man; namely, that the godly man is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely bleſſed, and the wicked man curſed, in the fiue firſt verſes. The other part ſhewes the chiefe cauſe of the happineſſe of the one, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of the other, verſe the ſixth: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> GOD <hi>knoweth;</hi> that is, likes, loues, and allowes; yea doth bleſſe and proſper the way of the one: but he hates, abhorres, and diſlikes the way of the other, and GOD doth curſe it and make it moſt vnhappy
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:173885:12"/> and miſerable vnto them: So that we ſee the ſumme of this Pſalme is this; that thoſe are bleſſed whoſe way, that is, whoſe life and conuerſation the LORD loues, likes, and allowes of, ſo as he doth direct and bleſſe it: But the LORD allowes and takes care of the way of the righteous and godly man, therefore the godly man is bleſſed.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing this is the maine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of this Pſalme to proue that the godly are bleſſed: Therefore the Prophet doth firſt ſhew who bee truely godly, as verſe 1.2. and then wherein their bleſſedneſſe doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, <hi>v.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>The godly man is deſcribed two waies: Firſt, Negatiuely, ſhewing what hee doth carefully ſhunne and auoide, <hi>v.</hi> 1. Secondly, Affirmatiuely, ſhewing what he doth carefully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and follow, <hi>v.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Concerning the things which the godly man doth euer carefully ſhun and auoide, they are heere laid down to bee three in number, by a moſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:173885:13"/> excellent kind of ſpeech, laid downe by way of graduation, wherein the Prophet ſhewes how men proceed by degrees to bee wicked, for there is an increaſe and proceeding in ſin,<note place="margin">Three ſorts of wicked men.</note> as we may ſee in euery ſtep of this graduation; firſt, in the perſons, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in the manner, and thirdly in the ſin it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>And indeed there is a variety and multiplicity of ſinnes, and as they are diuers and of diuers kinds, ſo the variety of number cauſeth a diuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of names: <hi>The counſell of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; the way of ſinners; the ſeate of the ſcornefull.</hi> For as one ſaith well, there is a fruitfull crop of ſinne,<note place="margin">Peccata frugifera ſeges, &amp;c. Cypri. ſer. de morta.</note> and there is none of the ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> but may ſay with <hi>Manaſſes</hi> in his prayer, <hi>I haue ſinned aboue the number of the ſand of the ſea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt <hi>(Hee doth not walke in the councell of the wicked)</hi> where we ſee the perſons are ſaid to be wicked; the originall word ſignifieth a man that is neuer quiet, but euer thinking or doing ſomething that is euill, like
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:173885:13"/> the raging ſea, whoſe minde is euer troubled and tempted with euill thoughts and perturbations. By Counſell hee vnderſtandeth heere the craftes and ſubtelties of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, by which they puſh themſelues forward, and labour to draw others to the like, according to that of <hi>Salomon: My ſonne, if ſinners intiſe thee conſent thou not,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pr. 1.10.11 Prou. 4 14.</note> 
                  <hi>if they ſay come let vs lay waite for bloud, &amp;c.</hi> So that the Prophet meaneth heere, that hee is bleſſed that ioyneth not himſelfe to commit ſinne with the vngodly, nor by himſelfe doth commit the ſame as ſinners do.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort of euill men, whoſe company hee doth auoide are called <hi>Sinners;</hi> the word ſignifies ſuch as not onely are of a naughty heart, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeduced by bad counſell, liue in ſinne; but ſuch as delight in ſin, and haue in them a conſtant and ſetled purpoſe to liue in ſinne.</p>
               <p>The third ſort of euill men, whoſe company he doth auoide, are called <hi>Scorners:</hi> And they are ſuch kind of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:173885:14"/> wicked men, as being hardened in heart, do ſtill confirme themſelues in their wicked life, and get ſuch a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite and cuſtome in ſinne that they ſhame not to make a mock of GOD and all godlineſſe, and euen to bleare out the tongue at Religion and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian piety, ſo that as they are wicked in heart, and lewd in life, ſo be they alſo hardened and confirmed in both of them, for by <hi>Seate,</hi> he noteth the fellowſhip and ſociety with the vngodly.<note place="margin">Pſal. 26.4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</note> Secondly, concerning the action, the firſt is, <hi>to walke in the counſell of the wicked:</hi> To walke, is to liue and frame his life, to affect and approue of the waies and counſels of wicked men, neither will hee once liſten or lend his eare to the peruerſe and naughty counſell of vngodly men, much leſſe will hee bee brought to frame his life after their wicked waies.</p>
               <p>The ſecond action or proceeding of a ſinner is <hi>Standing;</hi> as the former is in heart to like, loue, and approue
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:173885:14"/> of the waies of the wicked, this is to obey them and follow them into the ſame exceſſe of riot: So that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Prophet is, that a godly man doth not like, loue, nor follow, that kind of life, or conuerſation, which wicked men do vſe, and ſuch as be giuen to ſinne; according to that of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Faſhion not your ſelues like vnto the world:</hi> but doth by all meanes poſſibly ſhunne and auoide it.</p>
               <p>The third euill which the godly man doth moſt carefully auoide, is in theſe words, and <hi>hath not ſit in the aſſembly of the ſcorners:</hi> that is, will not bee familliar, and haue acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, with ſuch as bee mockers of God, and all good duties; hee will not bee their companion, nor keepe them company, who do openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe impiety, who make a ſcoffe at all Religion, ſcorne the word of God, and contemne the Seruants of God: Theſe be the three euils which the godly man doth moſt carefully ſhun and auoide.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:173885:15"/>
               <p>In the whole wee may obſerue the wonderfull growth that ſinne hath in the heart of a ſinner, it ſtands not at a ſtay, but is euer growing, and neuer ſuffers any wintertide of blaſting, but euer proſpers: It firſt beginneth in the heart of the ſinner with a doubtfull walking, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, as it were, vp and downe, as being vncertaine what to do; the next ſtep that it maketh is from <hi>Walking</hi> to <hi>Standing,</hi> which ſignifies a determination after the former vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainety, and where ſinne is not ſtayed neither in the conception, nor in the birth,<note place="margin">Iam. 1.15.</note> 
                  <hi>When it is finiſhed it brings forth death,</hi> euer ending in hardneſſe of heart, obſtinacy of minde, and obduracy of both. Oh that all wicked and vngodly men would lay this to heart, that making once ſhipwrack of faith and a good conſcience, and wounding their ſoules by ſinne! this ſpirituall diſeaſe of ſinne growes daily to bee more incurable, and the more ſin grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to bee a head, the more the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:173885:15"/> of God is quenched in a man, and the worke of grace is dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. It behoues vs all therefore to keepe a dilligent watch ouer our owne waies, to cut off the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſinne, and to ſtay the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of iniquity; for a fire new kindled may eaſily bee quenched; when the Ship beginnes to leake it may eaſily bee ſtopped; and at the firſt ſinne and ſathan may eaſily bee reſiſted, and wee may with the leſſe difficulty withſtand the force of it; whereas the more it is practiſed, the more the heart is hardned, and ſinne growes ſtronger, and the ſinner him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe weaker, according to that of the Prophet:<note place="margin">Ier. 13.23.</note> 
                  <hi>Can the Blackmore change his skinne, or the Leopard his ſpots, then may yee alſo do good, which are accuſtomed to do euill.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to this end the Lord laboured with <hi>Cain</hi> to ſtoppe his ſinne in the conception, or at leaſt in the birth, when that hee ſaw that his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was caſt downe, and that he had conceiued ſome euill againſt his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:173885:16"/> brother, the Lord tels <hi>Cain, If thou doſt well ſhalt thou not bee rewarded, if thou doſt euill, ſinne lyeth at thy dore:</hi> q. d. <hi>Cain, Cain,</hi> bee warned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ere it be too late, there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that will follow thy righteous dealing, but if thou go on to kill thy righteous brother, thou ſhalt find that thy condition will bee farre worſe then now it is. This is the wofull and miſerable condition of thoſe that runne from euill to worſe, as it were, adding drunkenneſſe to thirſt, and may bee a warning to vs to take heed leaſt at any time wee giue any entertainement to ſin: <hi>And ſo our laſt end bee worſe then the firſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 8.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſecond Verſe the Prophet deſcribes a godly man affirmatiuely ſhewing what he doth moſt careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embrace and follow:<note place="margin">The godly mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely.</note> As if hee ſhould ſay, Hee is a bleſſed man that abſtaines from euill, if ſo be withall hee delight to doe good; ſo hee doe willingly yeeld himſelfe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme obedience to the will of God, and conforme all his thoughts,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:173885:16"/> wordes, and deeds, to the will of God.</p>
               <p>Now the good things which hee muſt do are contained in two words: Firſt, <hi>His delight muſt bee in the Law of the Lord:</hi> Secondly, <hi>Hee muſt meditate therein day and night.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But his delight,</hi> that is, the godly man, who is truely happy and bleſſed indeed, doth wonderfully loue the <hi>Law,</hi> that is, the word of God, and that heauenly doctrine, wherein is reuealed the will of God, whereunto all our thoughts, words, and workes, muſt bee conformed, and which maketh knowne vnto vs the way to eternall life and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>In this Law hee meditates day and night:</hi> That is, the godly man doth ſet his heart and mind vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the word and doctrine of God, ſo as hee doth thinke often, and much muſe vpon it; it is his daily medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo as hee ſets ſome time apart euery day to ſtudy it; Both to learne out of it how God muſt bee purely
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:173885:17"/> worſhipped, his owne life ordered, as alſo to learne thereby how to mainetaine and keepe faith and a good conſcience before God and man. And thus the godly man is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by both parts of his life, his eſchewing of euill, and his carefull and religious performing of good duties.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as wee haue ſeene a godly man deſcribed, ſo now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth wherein the happineſſe of this man conſiſts.</p>
               <p>This happy man is deſcribed two waies.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by a ſimilitude.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of a godly ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts.</note> Secondly, by the proſperous and good ſucceſſe of all hee doth.</p>
               <p>The happineſſe of the godly man is deſcribed by a ſimilitude, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a godly man is compared to a tree, which tree is deſcribed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by the place; namely, that it is a tree planted, not of it own grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>By the waters ſide;</hi> Euen by the freſh and ſpringing riuers, which is a reſemblance of our ingrafting into
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:173885:17"/> Ieſus Chriſt by faith, and the Spirit of God; ſo as wee receiue and draw iuice and nouriſhment from him continually.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is deſcribed by an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; namely, <hi>That it brings forth fruit in due ſeaſon:</hi> And this is a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of our regeneration, or of our obedience, becauſe the godly man being ingrafted into Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Pſal. 92.12 Math. 7.</note> doth by vertue of his Reſurrection bring forth the fruit of faith and obedience both to God and man; <hi>In due ſeaſon,</hi> that is, in time conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, when it may beſt ſeeme for the glory of God, and the good of our Neighbour.</p>

               <p>Secondly, the happineſſe of a godly man is deſcribed by that bleſſed ſucceſſe that God giues to all his affaires hee takes in hand, <hi>It ſhall proſper,</hi> becauſe hee takes them in hand according to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and in his feare, with prayer and calling on the name of the Lord, <hi>Ioſhuah</hi> 1.8. to the glory of God, and the good of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>

That it is cleane contrary, that as their waies and liues bee contrary, ſo their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and end is contrary.</p>
               <p>The Prophet deſcribing the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and miſerable eſtate of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſaith firſt, <hi>It is not ſo with them:</hi> that is, the wicked and vngodly men are in a far contrary eſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; they cannot in any caſe bee compared to a tree that is planted by the riuers of waters, that brings
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:173885:18"/> forth her fruit in due ſeaſon, and whoſe leafe doth not fall, neither do they proſper in their actions, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth GOD giue ſucceſſe vnto them.</p>
               <p>But hee ſetteth out the curſed and wretched eſtate of all wicked and vngodly men, by a contrary ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, comparing them to Chaffe, which the winde driues away; That is, euen as chaffe hath no roote in the earth, and wanting all iuyce and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, muſt needes bee fruitleſſe and dry, ſo as the winde doth moſt eaſily ſcatter it away: Euen ſo the wicked are not rooted nor groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Chriſt, whereby it comes to paſſe, they being vtterly void of all grace of Gods Spirit, that they can bring forth no fruite of good workes, neither can they perſeuere in time of temptation, whereby a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine it comes to paſſe, that they be carried away with euery blaſt of vaine doctrine, and with the leaſt ſtorme of temptation, and blaſt of aduerſity they are toſſed to and fro;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:173885:19"/> And when the wind of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall blow vpon them, they are cleane ſcattered away. This is their eſtate and condition heere in this life.</p>
               <p>And for their eſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the life to come, the Prophet layeth it downe likewiſe, <hi>verſe</hi> 5. in theſe words; <hi>They ſhall not bee able to ſtand in Iudgement:</hi> That is, they ſhall not bee able to ſtand with comfort before the face of the Iudge,<note place="margin">Reu. 6.13.</note> but ſhall tremble and quake, as not being able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the angry countenance of the Iudge.</p>
               <p>Neither is this all, but they ſhall likewiſe bee ſeuered and ſecluded from the bleſſed company of the godly; That as heere in this life they could not abide a godly man, but did hate him, perſecute him, and ſhunne his company; So at the laſt day (ſo iuſt ſhall their reward bee) that they ſhall bee ſeparated from them; And as Goats caſt on the left hand,<note place="margin">Mat, 25.34</note> there to remaine for euermore

The Lord giues <hi>Ioſhuah</hi> a ſtraight charge to doe thus: <hi>Let not the Booke of the Lawe depart out of thy mouth: But me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate therein day and night: That thou mayeſt obſerue and doe according to all that is written therein, for then ſhalt thou make thy way proſperous, and thou ſhalt then haue good ſucceſſe, Ioſhua</hi> 1.8. and <hi>Deuteron.</hi> 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6.7.8. And thus the ſeruants of God haue been much exerciſed in meditation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by haue growne woonderfull, not only in knowledge, but in practiſe, as we may ſee in <hi>Dauid, Pſa.</hi> 119. who tooke great delight in Gods Lawe, and made it his meditation continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. And of <hi>Iſaac</hi> it is reported, that hee went out into the fieldes in the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:173885:79"/> euening to meditate, <hi>Geneſis cha.</hi> 24.</p>
                  <p>This reprooues the common fault <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> in the world, that moſt men vtterly neglect this duety, ſeldome or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſettle themſelues to meditate in the Lawe of God, and his heauenly Doctrine. It is hard to finde a man or woman that makes any conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of this duetie, to ſet themſelues apart, and ſet themſelues in Gods preſence, to call to minde, that they haue heard and learned, to applie it to themſelues in particular, to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them, or to comfort them. And this is the cauſe why moſt men hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and reading, ſo much as they haue, yet profit ſo little in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, faith, repentance, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. They can be content to heare the word preached and taught, and it may be, now and then to reade a chapter: but to thinke vpon it, to ruminate vpon the word of God, and as it were to chew the Cudde, to call the ſame to minde againe, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie it to themſelues, to labour to profit by it: this they cannot indure,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:173885:79"/> this they care not for. For if men did carefully meditate of the things they heard and read, how could they be ſo ignorant in Gods word as moſt be? So voyde of knowledge, faith, repentance, humilitie, zeale, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the like gifts and graces, which accompany godlie and holie meditation? For bookes of Statutes men wil not only haue them in their houſes, but at their fingers ends: but Bible they haue none: And if they haue, it lieth vpon the deske or table, and they reade it not. And if ſometimes they reade, yet they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer meditate thereon.</p>
                  <p>This may admoniſh all men, as <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> they loue their owne ſoules, to make more care and conſcience of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this duetie, to call to minde that wee doe heare or reade, to thinke and muſe vpon it, to chew the Cudde, to lay it to heart; yea, and to applie it to our owne ſoules and conſciences in particular: This is like the rumination or chewing of the Cudde to lay it to bee found
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:173885:80"/> onely in the cleane beaſts, whereas they which chewed not the Cudde,<note place="margin">Deuter. 14 6.7.</note> were vncleane: This is the marke and propertie of a godlie and <hi>Bleſſed man,</hi> whereas the not doing it, is the marke of a wicked &amp; vngodly man. Let vs then remember that we make the word of God our Meditation continually. Many men meditate much, ſome in one thing, and ſome in another, as they are led by fond affection: ſome thinke of honours, ſome of pleaſures, ſome of riches, ſome of one thing, and ſome of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. And of theſe they doate and dreame, talke, and ſpeake continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. But heere wee are taught ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leſſon, namely, that our mindes muſt eſpecially be ſet vpon the word of God, that muſt be our delight, and the ioy of our heart.</p>

                     <note place="margin">3. Point.</note> The laſt point in this Verſe, is the circumſtance of Time, namely, not by fittes: But the godly man keepes a continuall courſe in the ſtudy and meditation of the word of God, ſo as hee ſetteth apart ſome time for the

                  <p>Hence wee learne, that euery one<note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctr. 4.

                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:173885:84"/> So many could be content to ſerue God, and to pray vnto him, but they muſt keepe their friends com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: or as thoſe that were bidden to the feaſt; One hath his oxen and gaine to hinder him, an other his wife, his pleaſures and delights, which hee is married vnto, and ſo can finde no time to ſerue God, euen the leaſt thing in the world is matter ſufficient to hinder them from ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of God, theſe men ſhew that they find no comfort at all in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of Almighty God, no good, no fruit, no benefite: for if they did, they would not be ſuch ſtrangers vnto it.</p>

Hee hath his head which is the root, and haire as ſmall rootes, his body as the ſtock, and his armes and legges as ſo many boughes, and fingers and toes as leſſer twigges: Onely the difference betweene the naturall tree, and man this Myſticall Tree is this: The naturall tree is rooted in the earth,<note place="margin">Gen. 27.28.</note> receiuing as <hi>Eſaus</hi> bleſſing the <hi>Fatneſſe of the ſame;</hi> but man, this <hi>Heauenly Plant,</hi> deriues not his iuice and nouriſhment from the fatneſſe of the earth but from heauen aboue, according to Gods wiſe diſpoſing of his roote, which is aboue not below: and therefore are we exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Apoſtle to ſet our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on heauenly things, and not on

                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, for the circumſtance of <hi>time</hi> when the plants of the earth are thus remoued, and that not vſually in Sommer, when the heate of the yeare is vp, and the ſap is gone vp into the plant, but in the winter
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:173885:93"/> time this is vſually to bee ſeene for the moſt part.

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, as a Plant is remoued, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> not when it is fruitfull, but remoued to that end it may be fruiefull: So fareth it with man this Myſticall Tree: Wee are not fruitfull by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture before ſuch time as we are <hi>plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> and ingrafted into Ieſus Chriſt, for till then wee bring forth nothing but bitter and vnſauory fruite; but

                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The plucking vp ſhadowes out vnto vs three things in the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a ſinner.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, it ſignifies our deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the power of originall ſinne thus: For as a <hi>Plant</hi> once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued receiues no more iuice nor nouriſhment from the old earth, from which it is remoued, but from that ſoyle into the which it is plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: So fareth it with this heauenly <hi>Plant,</hi> being regenerate and ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Ieſus Chriſt, there will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſuch a change of will, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vnderſtanding, and the like fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of ſoule and body, that whereas before they were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther earthly, carnall, and vaine, ſo now they minde heauenly things, being ſanctified by the Spirit of Grace; and the power of Nature,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> that is, that old ſap of ſinne, being done away.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it ſignifies a Chriſtian mans ſorow for ſinne: for as no <hi>Plant</hi> can bee remoued from one place to another, but the axe, and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, of the Husbandman, muſt bee laid vnto it, and many a roote muſt bee cut off before it can bee

And as a noble mans ſeruant is knowne by his liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; ſo we may certainly iudge of men by their companie. A good man loues good companie, a godly man

            <p>O Lord God, by whoſe gracious prouidence the night ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the day, and the day the night, wee acknowledge thy wonderfull power therin: foraſmuch as day vnto day vttereth thy goodnes, and night vnto night teacheth knowledge: O Lord amongſt other thy mercies, with which thou doeſt euen follow vs (moſt rebellious wretches) wee muſt needs acknowledge that this is not the leaſt, that we haue this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to come into thy preſence, O Lord wee come not now to excuſe our ſelues, but to accuſe our ſelues; yea and to acknowledge, that we are worthy of all thoſe iudgements which thy iuſtice might moſt iuſtly inflict vpon vs, our ſinnes they make
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:173885:161"/> vs ſeeme vile in our eyes, how much more loathſome in thy ſight? O Lord we muſt needs confeſſe that we are ſo farre vnworthy to bee called thy ſonnes, as that we are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to bee reckoned amongſt thy ſeruants; yea were it not that thou wert a God of mercy, and that thy mercy were ouer all thy workes, and doth extend it ſelfe euen to poore ſinners; we ſhould vtterly be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged in comming vnto thee, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that our whole life hath been but a life of ſinne, and that we haue drunke downe iniquity as it were water, euer powring in, but neuer powring out our filthineſſe. O Lord teach vs to value this mercy of thine aright, that thou haſt ſpared vs ſo long, and giuen vs ſo large a time of repentance; that thou haſt not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented vs with death in the time of our ignorance, &amp; hardneſſe of heart, as many haue beene before vs: O Lord it is thy mercy not our worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Thus haſt thou ſhewed thy ſelfe to be a God of mercy, one that
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:173885:161"/> delighteth in the proſperity of thy ſeruants. Now Lord we humbly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat thee that thou wouldſt pardon and forgiue vs all our ſins and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, bathe them in the bloud of thy Sonne, naile them to his Croſſe, bind them in a bundle, and throw them downe into the bottome of the ſea, that they may neuer riſe vp againſt vs, either in this world to accuſe vs, or in the world to come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne vs. O Lord wee are heartily ſorry that wee haue abuſed thy bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, prophaned thy Saboths, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed thy word, and quenched thy Spirit: For theſe and the like (bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed father) we condemne our ſelues, do not thou therefore marke them; nor deale not with vs as we haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, but teach vs to riſe vp againſt our ſinnes, that our warre with them may aſſure vs that wee haue peace with thee: O Lord we abhorre our ſelues, for to vs belongs nothing but ſhame and confuſion of face for euer: and we do humbly entreat thee to looke vpon vs in thy Son Chriſt
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:173885:162"/> Ieſus, O let the chaſtiſement of our peace bee vpon him, and heale vs through his ſtripes: Lord let vs euer remember our latter end, and the ſtraight reckoning that we muſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vnto thee one day: and in health and proſperity to thinke of a time of ſickneſſe and aduerſity; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially good Lord deliuer vs in the houre of temptation, that when Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than his aſſaults ſhall be greateſt, as his policy is when wee are weakeſt, and leaſt able to reſiſt him, that thy power may then appeare in our weakneſſe, that theſe things may not ouertake vs as a ſnare, but that with the wiſe virgins wee may in ſome ſort bee prepared for the comming of Chriſt Ieſus the ſweete Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome of our ſoules. And to that end we may haue comfort both now and at that time, goe forward wee humbly pray thee, with the worke of our new birth, that thou haſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in vs, and neuer take away thy hand vntill ſuch time as thou haſt made an end of it. And now O Lord
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:173885:162"/> hauing in the firſt place ſought thy kingdome, and the righteouſneſſe thereof, giue vs leaue in the next place to ſeek thy fauour in outward things: Firſt, according to our duty, we giue thee hearty thankes &amp; praiſe for that thou haſt this day preſerued vs from all euill and danger: wee humbly pray thee take care ouer vs this night, and defend vs from that roaring Lyon, who night and day goeth about ſeeking whom hee may deuoure: Take thou vs this night in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy bleſſed tuition: we know that thou doſt neither ſlumber nor ſleepe, keepe vs euen in our ſleepe from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnmindfull of thee, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer thou ſhalt call for vs by the generall Alarum of thy iudgement, whether at mid-night, at Cocke-crowing, or at the dawning of the day, we may bee found ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the Bridegroome into the Marriage-chamber.

And we beſeech thee O Lord to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull likewiſe to thy whole Church, heare the cries of thine elect; heare the mourning of all ſuch as mourne in <hi>Syon,</hi> let the cries of thy children cry downe the cries of the ſinnes of this land: and bee reconciled vnto vs O Lord our God in the multitude of thy mercies, that ſo thou maiſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtill a mercifull God vnto this Land, the Vineyard which thy own right hand hath planted.
